<h3>Maps</h3> It would be very easy to implement new maps with the map parser I built. I could even let others create maps with relative ease. What isn't so easy is playtesting these maps significantly enough to ensure they are interesting and balanced.</p>

<h3>Pickups</h3> I could definitely see a power weapon that allowed one to instantly shoot someone instead of firing after move actions. Could also see something a like a heat seeking missile that took multiple turns to blow up but tracked the target throughout multiple turns.</p>

<h3>Fix Turtling</h3> Turtling can be a problem with pure deathmatch. That being said there is only one map and smaller maps may not have such an issue. Additionally, there are a number of tweaks I feel could be implemented to the basic deathmatch mode that could increase enemy engagement, especially in the endgame. A poison mechanic that drained your soldier's health after so many turns seems cheap, and cutting the game off after so many turns could disincentivise some potential strategies which I feel should be viable. Things like respawning powerups in the middle seem promising however, as it would force player's back to middle. I'll have to think on it as well as test it.</p>

<p>Or I could avoid the deathmatch problem altogether and make objective gametypes like bomb and CTF the base gametypes. I can envision practically any sort of common FPS gametype being translated into this playspace and working quite well.</p>
